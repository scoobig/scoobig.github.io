    <h2>Greedy Jackal Soul Debt Emporium</h2>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>The Greedy Jackal's Soul-Debt Emporium</strong>, the only establishment where regret is a commodity and misery is currency! We are not a pawn shop for your valuables, but for your <strong>vulnerabilities</strong>. This truly evil business profits by trading in the spiritual detritus of human failure and misfortune. While others sell clothes or coffee, we sell <strong>Soul Debts</strong>—those little pieces of guilt, broken promises, and social awkwardness that weigh down the soul.</p>
    <p>Our limited, specialized inventory consists of highly specific, one-of-a-kind emotional relics. You can browse our collection of <strong>Regretted Texts</strong> (sealed, framed transcripts of texts you wish you'd never sent), purchase <strong>Tear Catchers</strong> (small vials of collected sorrow labeled by the source of the grief), or bid on a <strong>Silent Oath</strong> (lockets engraved with promises long since broken). The Jackal, with his insatiable <strong>greed</strong>, is always waiting to buy those painful remnants, packaging them up for a price and ensuring your misfortune becomes his fortune.</p>

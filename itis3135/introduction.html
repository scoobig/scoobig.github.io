            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>Hey! My name is Gabrielle, though some people call me Gabbi (I have no preference toward either). I am a 2nd year majoring in Computer Science, with a minor in German. I have been interested in Computer Science since doing FRC in high school, and I wish to carry that into my career. My goal is to graduate from UNCC with a bachelor's in computer science, and a concentration in software engineering.</p>

            <h3>Personal Background</h3>
            <p>In the year 2006, I was born in Charlotte, NC. I've lived here my whole life, and been interested in computers since then. In middle school, I began programming– attending various camps, and other things of the sort. I am also a big fan of games (mostly story-based), and overall app development.</p>

            <h3>Professional Background</h3>
            <p>Since 16, I have been working as a barista. Other than that, I've tutored, worked programming summer camps, and other various jobs.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Academic Background</h3>
            <p>Starting my Associate's degree in high school, I took an extra year after I graduated, finishing it off at CPCC, before transferring to UNCC this year. I am a sophomore by standing, but I qualify as a junior, credit wise. I am unsure whether or not my graduation date will be 2027 or 2028, because I have plans to study abroad.</p>

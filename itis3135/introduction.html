                <li><strong>About me:</strong> Hey! My name is Gabrielle, though some people call me Gabbi (I have no preference toward either). I am a 2nd year majoring in Computer Science, with a minor in German. I have been interested in Computer Science since doing FRC in high school, and I wish to carry that into my career. My goal is to graduate from UNCC with a bachelor's in computer science, and a concentration in software engineering.</li>
                <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> In the year 2006, I was born in Charlotte, NC. I've lived here my whole life, and been interested in computers since then. In middle school, I began programming– attending various camps, and other things of the sort. I am also a big fan of games (mostly story-based), and overall app development.</li>
                <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> Since 16, I have been working as a barista. Other than that, I've tutored, worked programming summer camps, and other various jobs.</li>
                <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> Starting my Associate's degree in high school, I took an extra year after I graduated, finishing it off at CPCC, before transferring to UNCC this year. I am a sophomore by standing, but I qualify as a junior, credit wise. I am unsure whether or not my graduation date will be 2027 or 2028, because I have plans to study abroad.</li>
                <li><strong>Primary Computer:</strong> At home: Windows desktop, custom-built. At school: Windows Dell laptop.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Courses I'm Taking, & Why:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>ITSC 2600 - Computer Science Program, Identity, Career:</strong> Required class.</li>
                        <li><strong>ITSC 3688 - Computers and Their Impact on Society:</strong> Required class, but I was interested in the ethical side of computers, and whatnot.</li>
                        <li><strong>GERM 1201 - Elementary German I:</strong> I have been interested in German since high school, but never got a chance to formally take it.</li>
                        <li><strong>STAT 2122 - Intro to Prob & Stat:</strong> Required class (my last math!)</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Interesting Item to Remember Me by:</strong> I have a evil cat named Garou. (He meows all the time.)</li>
            </ul>

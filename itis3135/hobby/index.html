            <h2>What is Rock Climbing?</h2>
            <p>Rock climbing is a physically and mentally demanding sport in which participants climb up, down, or across natural rock formations or artificial rock walls. The goal is to reach the summit of a formation or the endpoint of a pre-defined route without falling. It tests a climber's strength, endurance, agility, and balance, along with mental control.</p>

            <h3>The Disciplines of Climbing</h3>
            <p>Climbing has several sub-disciplines, each with its own gear and risk profile:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bouldering:</strong> Climbing without ropes on small rock formations or walls, relying on crash pads for safety.</li>
                <li><strong>Sport Climbing:</strong> Climbing protected by permanent bolts fixed to the rock, using a rope and quickdraws.</li>
                <li><strong>Traditional (Trad) Climbing:</strong> Placing temporary protective devices (cams, nuts) into the rock, which are removed after the climb.</li>
                <li><strong>Aid Climbing:</strong> Using equipment to help ascend, not just for protection.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>When is the Best Time to Climb?</h2>
            <p>The ideal time for climbing is highly dependent on location, but generally, spring and fall offer the best conditions. These shoulder seasons typically provide stable, cooler temperatures that are ideal for grip and endurance, avoiding the extreme heat of summer and the ice/snow of winter.</p>

        <section id="how" class="section-content">
            <h2>How to Get Started in Climbing</h2>
            <p>Starting rock climbing is more accessible than ever before. The safest and most efficient way to begin is by visiting a local indoor climbing gym. They provide all the rental gear, introductory classes, and supervision you need to get a feel for the sport.</p>

            <h3>The Three Steps to Your First Climb</h3>
            <p>Follow these steps to transition from curious beginner to competent climber:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Visit a Gym:</strong> Try bouldering first. It requires minimal gear (just shoes) and teaches fundamental movement patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Take a Belay Class:</strong> If you want to use ropes (top-roping), you must learn how to properly 'belay' (manage the rope) for your partner. Most gyms offer certified classes.</li>
                <li><strong>Invest in Gear:</strong> Once you're hooked, buy your own climbing shoes and chalk bag. These personal items make a big difference in comfort and performance.</li>
            </ol>

    <h2>Design & Development Notes</h2>
    <p>This section documents the requirements and design decisions used to build the page. The site was created to satisfy course/project specifications: a single-file HTML document with embedded stylesheet, a header/main/footer layout, and six content sections (What, Who, When, Where, How, Why). Navigation is implemented so only one section is visible at a time; the "What" section appears by default.</p>

    <h3>Styling Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>CRAP-based layout and visual hierarchy.</li>
        <li>Color scheme: deep teal (<code>#4a6d71</code>) and bright gold (<code>#ffcc66</code>); off-white page background (<code>#f4f4e8</code>).</li>
        <li>No Times New Roman, no plain black body text, and no generic blue underlined links.</li>
        <li>Navigation links are high-contrast and clearly clickable for accessibility.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Content Notes</h3>
    <p>The "Who" section emphasizes community and diversity. The "When" section includes a three-column table covering seasonal considerations (Season, Conditions, Discipline Focus). Images shown are placeholders and should be replaced with original or properly licensed media as needed.</p>
